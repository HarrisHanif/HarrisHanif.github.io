    <h2>Is the Stock Market just The Fed's liquidity?</h2>


    <div class="project">

     <h2>Aim:</h2>

     <p>As the world enters another year, the gloomy economic outlook from 2022 remains. 
        “Unprecedented” events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have 
        been blamed by governments and media for the hardships the population now endure. 
        This narrative has helped justify the worst stock market performance since 2008. 
        In this project I hope to demonstrate that this terrible market is not as a result 
        of international struggles but instead a product of the Federal Reserve’s inability
         to turn of the “money printers”, as is typically the case during the fall of most empires.</p>

     <!--Total Assets and TGA-->

    </div>


     

     <p>The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the Fed Funds Rate used to be key drivers of the US stock market 
        however, in 2020 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the financial rules were rewritten. 
        In July 2020, the Federal Reserve doubled the size of its balance sheet ‘printing’ almost $4.5 trillion. 
        Quantitative easing has been a common policy in the western world since the Global Financial Crisis 
        but this time the US Treasury also decided to provision itself with $1.8 trillion, almost 5x as much as
         it had ever given itself before! This outflow of money from the Treasury General Account became the sole 
         driver of markets and liquidity became the only thing that mattered.</p>


     <!--Inflation Chart-->

     <div class="chart" id="chart-3"></div>

     <p>However, this enormous release of liquidity drove inflation and the cost of living higher over a two-year 
        period as shown by the Median CPI. </p>

     <!--Treasury Bills and Award Rate Charts-->

     <div class="chart-container">

     <div class="chart" id="chart-4"></div>
     <div class="chart" id="chart-5"></div>

    </div>

     <p>In order to combat this rapidly rising inflation, the Treasury issued fewer short-dated Bills such as the 
        4-Week Treasury Bills to create a shortage of low duration financial paper which is essential to financial 
        institutions in order to stimulate the economy with liquidity. In addition, The FED increase the award rate
         on the Reverse Repo which is the next best alternative to short-dated Treasury Bills. Both of these measures 
         reached original levels in June 2022 when QT started.</p>

     <!--Reverse Repo Chart-->

     <div class="chart" id="chart-6"></div>

     <p>As a result, $2 trillion was consumed by the Reverse Repo and so, was unable to circulate in the economy. 
        This is approximately 6x more than had ever been done before. </p>

     <p>In the past, the size of the FED’s balance sheet roughly equalled Net Liquidity, which is the amount of 
        money that is available to circulate in the economy. The Treasury General Account and the Reverse Repo 
        did not typically influence Net Liquidity however, in 2020 the changes in the size of the Treasury General 
        Account and Reverse Repo were significantly greater than any changes to the FED’s Balance Sheet.
         Therefore, Net Liquidity should now be calculated as:</p>   

     <p>Net Liquidity = FED Balance Sheet - TGA - Reverse Repo </p>

     <!--Net Liquidity Correlation-->

     <div class="chart" id="chart-7"></div>
     
     <div class="chart" id="chart-8"></div>

     <p>Ever since July 2020 this Net Liquidity calculation has been the sole driver of the SP500 when offset by 2 weeks,
         which we can assume is the time taken for this liquidity to spread into the economy and impact asset prices.
        I performed a linear regression and achieved an R2 value of 0.98 indicating a very strong statistical significance. 
        Therefore, by calculating changes in Net Liquidity, one can predict the direction of the SP500 over the next 2-week period. </p>


     <h3>Data Used Including Notes on Automation and Replication and Challenges:</h3>

     <p>All of the data used in this project was taken from the FRED website. In order to gather the data to perform the 
        Net Liquidity calculation and subsequent linear regression I used the FRED API to import the relevant series into 
        a Python notebook in Google Collab, where I could merge them into a single data frame.  
        I converted this data frame into a CSV file which I downloaded into in order to conduct my analysis in Excel and 
        applying the data to a Vega chart. This same data was used to create a visual representation of the relationship 
        between the SP500 and Net Liquidity as well as the first two charts. APIs could not be used for these charts given
         the required data cleaning and manipulation and I decided not to use an API for the first two charts as the relevant
         information is in the past and I was worried about reaching the API Request limit. Live data would not add to the narrative.</p>

     <p>For the Reverse Repo, Reverse Repo Award Rate, 4-Week Treasury Bill and Median CPI charts I used the FRED API to incorporate live data into the website. </p>


     <P>I encountered an issue whereby some of the data from the FRED website would not be correctly visualised in Vega, 
        but the problem would fix itself when putting the same data into a different workbook. It was difficult to show the
         correlation between Net Liquidity and the SP500 and the incorporation of the 2-week lag was vital to reaching a sound conclusion.</P>
